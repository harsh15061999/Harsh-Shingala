He learned how to work with a variety of our databases and created a couple of dashboards that will be used by our FP&A/operations teams and sales reps and managers. He presented his findings and asked for feedback from a group of managers/directors that will be utilizing the dashboards. He learned how to use salesforce and assisted with sales rep-level questions and queries." - Jessie Alibozek, Global Sales Manager, Mimecast
